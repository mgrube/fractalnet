# fractalnet

This repository has code to simulate variations of small world routing on top of fractal lattices.

## Required Librares:
- networkx
- numpy
- matplotlib

I'd like to answer these questions:

- Can a handshake be devised to maintain a lattice for nodes that are joining with random locations?
- Is there an optimal shape? Is 1 dimension still the most practical choice?

Some things I'm going to try:

	- Cantor Set
	- Sierpinski Carpet
	- Sierpinski Triangle
